Test case name    : FMI2_ME_FMUSDK_2.0.3_dq
FMU name          : dq.fmu
Performed with    : xMOD 2015
Date              : 22-Dec-2015 16:36:50

To run the example with xMOD :

    1. Download a trial version of xMOD at http://www.xmodsoftware.com
    2. Double clic the FMI2_ME_FMUSDK_2.0.3_dq.zsimu file to import and open it in xMOD
    3. Run the simulation in as soon as possible mode (rabbit button). For a tutorial about using xMOD, please consult : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeUvUoYBQVw
    4. Result file will be generated with extension .002 under the FMI2_ME_FMUSDK_2.0.3_dq simulation directory under xMOD bench root directory

 Matlab figures (.fig files) of the obtained resulats are also available
 
 Remark : result match is obtained with Euler solver in xMOD, with same step-size
