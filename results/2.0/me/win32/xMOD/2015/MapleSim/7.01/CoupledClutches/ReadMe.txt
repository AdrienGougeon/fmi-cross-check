Test case name    : FMI2_ME_MapleSim_7.01_CoupledClutches
FMU name          : CoupledClutches.fmu
Performed with    : xMOD 2015
Date              : 22-Dec-2015 12:58:21

To run the example with xMOD :

    1. Download a trial version of xMOD at http://www.xmodsoftware.com
    2. Double clic the FMI2_ME_MapleSim_7.01_CoupledClutches.zsimu file to import and open it in xMOD
    3. Run the simulation in as soon as possible mode (rabbit button). For a tutorial about using xMOD, please consult : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeUvUoYBQVw
    4. Result file will be generated with extension .002 under the FMI2_ME_MapleSim_7.01_CoupledClutches simulation directory under xMOD bench root directory

 Matlab figures (.fig files) of the obtained resulats are also available
 
 xMOD results approach the solution, but not within tolerance requirement. No available solver to obtain satisfactory results
