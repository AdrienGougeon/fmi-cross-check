MoBA Lab 2017.1 Crosscheck Results
------------------------------------------

There reference results were generated with the MoBA Simulator for CommandLine.

The RunSimulation.bat starts the simulation, the RunCompare.bat starts the csv-compare tool. You might have to adapt the script to match your local paths.


Comments:
The FMU seems to work correctly in MoBA Lab. However, the version 6.1 has been removed from our software tests.
The difference between our result and the reference result could be caused by insufficient precision of the reference results or incorrect handling of the FMU in MoBA Lab.
