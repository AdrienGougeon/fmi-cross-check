Validation failed with csv compare
The csv comparison tool has knows problems with comparing
discrete signals. If declared as passed instead of failed,
manual checking of references has been done and deemed correct

Simulation result does not compare well with reference.
It does however compare good with simulation of controlled Tempereature in dymola so I consider the model a pass
