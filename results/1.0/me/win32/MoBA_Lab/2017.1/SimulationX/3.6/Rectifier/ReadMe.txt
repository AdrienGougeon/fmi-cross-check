MoBA Lab 2017.1 Crosscheck Results
------------------------------------------

There reference results were generated with the MoBA Simulator for CommandLine.

The RunSimulation.bat starts the simulation, the RunCompare.bat starts the csv-compare tool. You might have to adapt the script to match your local paths.


Comments:
The FMU seems to work correctly in MoBA Lab. However, the version 3.6 has been removed from our software tests.
