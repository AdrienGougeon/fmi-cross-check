Import process:
It is an FMU for Model Exchange, version 1.0, running on win32

Model description not ok. There are some error(s).
Error(s):
The parameters constantVoltage.p.v (alias), constantVoltage.V share the same value reference, which is not allowed
Warning(s):
Variable constantVoltage.v is declared as an alias of constantVoltage.V but they do not match
