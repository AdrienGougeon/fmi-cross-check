Notes: 

To redo this test please run the generated python script in this folder after copying the fmu and input file (if any) to this folder.




The correspondance between variables in the fmu and variables in the
_ref.csv file is not perfect, some variables do not match.


The cross checking test ran successfully and the results are correct, see the html file.
