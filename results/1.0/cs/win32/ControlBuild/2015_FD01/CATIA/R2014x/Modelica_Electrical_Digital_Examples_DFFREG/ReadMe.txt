Tested using: ControlBuild 2015_FD01

Tested FMU: CoSimulation\win32\CATIA\R2014x\Modelica_Electrical_Digital_Examples_DFFREG.fmu

If the FMU failed, the exception is found in 'exception.txt'
If the FMU simulated succesfully, the result is found in 'result.csv'
If the FMU simulated succesfully and input was specified, the result is found in 'input_result.csv'

Simulating from t=0.0 to t=25 

Input:  None (Unmatched: None)
Output: All variables in the FMU

Simulating the FMU succeeded...

Results:
  The results did not match the reference results within the allowed tolerance.
  Differences in results are a result of sample time differences between tools.
  Record was done during the executable simulation.
  Also only the following variables are recorded: dFFREG.dataOut[1] and dFFREG.dataOut[2]
  Passed after user review
