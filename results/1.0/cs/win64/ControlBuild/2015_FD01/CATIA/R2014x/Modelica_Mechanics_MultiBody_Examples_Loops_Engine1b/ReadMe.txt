regarding 
Simulating the FMU succeeded...

Results:
  The results did not match the reference results within the allowed tolerance.
  Differences in results are a result of sample time differences between tools.
  Not the same numbers of records,record was done during the executable simulation.
  Also only following variable are records: Bearing.phi and Bearing.w.
