Testcase Specific Remarks:

Note that the output file has been post-processed to remove unneeded
string fields that contained embedded newlines which could lead to
errors in CSV file validation.  The original file has been retained
as compute_out.full.

The field 1,513 and 515 in cut 1-based indexing have been retained.
